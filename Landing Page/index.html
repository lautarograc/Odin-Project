        <p>The "City of Caesars" is a legendary city hidden among the Andine Patagonia.
            It's rumoured to be the last home of the Inca, storaging lots of gold 
            and precious jewels. A long target of Spanish explorers, nobody ever found it.
        </p></ul>
        <ul><a href=""><img id="storyimg" src="images/luz-mala.jpg"></a>
        <p>The "Luz Mala" (literally "Bad Light") is an old gaucho tale.
            It's an static bright, cold light that is assumed to be an
            errant spirit, probably from a deceased christian who didn't receive
            proper burial services. This light can negatively curse anyone who finds it.
            To prevent the curse, some say that you must attack the light with a facón (traditional gaucho knife).

        </p></ul>
        <ul><a href=""><img id="storyimg" src="images/fantasmas-delta.jpg"></a>
        <p>The ghost pirates of Los Bajos de Temor have their origin at the late XIX century,
            right at the entrance to the Delta del Tigre. A pirate band that roamed the Paraná River
            After a tough standoff with local law enforcement, this pirate gang was officialy
            beaten and dissolved. However, no local was able to confirm the death of the captain of this gang,
            but with the piratery cases dissapearing, everybody thought that every pirate vessel was properly sunk.
            Weeks later, strange things started to happen to the local population. Cattle suddenly dying,
            occasional fires, loud screechings late in the night and an strange energy around the River
            were enough to classify this portion of the Paraná Delta as a cursed location.

<div id="quote"><p>As a folklorist, 
    I have come to believe that no piece of folklore continues 
    to be transmitted unless it means something - even if neither 
    the speaker nor the audience can articulate what that meaning might be.
