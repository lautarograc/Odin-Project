        <ul>3 (3.5 ounce) links hot Italian sausage, sliced</ul>
        
        <ul>1 (8 ounce) package baby portobello mushrooms, sliced</ul>
        
        <ul>1 small onion, diced</ul>
        
        <ul>2 cups vodka marinara sauce</ul>
        
        <ul>1 teaspoon ground thyme</ul>
        
        <ul>sea salt and ground black pepper to taste</ul>

    <h2><strong>Recipe steps:</strong></h2>
    <div class="recipe-steps">
        <li><strong>Step 1</strong>
            Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over
             medium-high heat. Add sausage and cook,
              stirring occasionally, until browned, 5 to 7 minutes.
               Remove sausage and set aside,
                leaving residual oil in the pan.</li>
  <li><strong>Step 2</strong>
    Add mushrooms, onion, and remaining olive oil to the same skillet.
     Cover and cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally,
      until cooked down, about 15 minutes.
       Return sausage to the skillet; add vodka sauce,
        thyme, salt, and pepper and allow sauce flavors to meld, 
        about 10 minutes.</li>

        <li><strong>Step 3</strong>
            Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
             Cook gnocchi in the boiling water until they float to the top,
              2 to 4 minutes. Drain and season with salt and pepper.
